# Polycade Engineering QA Challenge

We need to add lots of features quickly and be sure not to break any existing functionality. We want to make sure that you can review our engineers' work and catch any issues before our users do. Can you review pull requests and communicate with engineers?

## The Challenge

We have a todo app that is using [todoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) as its base, we'd like to add new features. These features are described in two open issues. An engineer has created two new pull requests satisfy the issues. Your challenge is to investigate these two pull requests and make sure that the features work correctly and will not negatively impact the user experience.

## Instructions

How to attempt this challenge:

1) Do not fork, comment, open issues, or otherwise interact directly with this repo.
2) To see the current, deployed version of our app, visit https://polycade-qa-challenge.netlify.com/
3) View the [list of open pull requests](https://github.com/polycade/challenge-qa/pulls)
4) We use [Netlify Deploy Previews](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/). You may view a deploy preview for each pull request by clicking on the appropriate link in the "checks" section of the PR.
5) Investigate the pull requests. Take note of any problems.
6) Create a [Secret Gist](https://gist.github.com) with your notes, and send its URL to your hiring contact.
